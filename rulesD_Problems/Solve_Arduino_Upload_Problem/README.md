By running this script, you configure your Linux system to allow non-root users to access USB devices like Arduino boards. This resolves permission issues that can prevent you from uploading sketches using PlatformIO in VSCode or any other development environment. The script automates the process of downloading, installing, and applying the necessary udev rules, making it easier to set up your development environment.

The script you provided is used to configure udev rules on a Linux system to allow non-root users to access USB devices, such as Arduino boards, without needing root permissions.

**Permission Issues**:
  - When you connect an Arduino board to your Linux system via USB, the system may restrict access to the device to root users only. This can cause issues when trying to upload sketches using PlatformIO or any other development environment.

**Non-Root Access**:
  - The script sets up udev rules that change the permissions of the USB devices to allow non-root users to access them. This means you can upload sketches to your Arduino without needing to run your development environment as a root user.
